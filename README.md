- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexScarboro
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, computer science, PC hardware and gaming, sports, traveling, and spending time with friends and family.
- 🌱 So far, my programming knowledge consists of classes taken at Wake Technical Community College and at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Classes that I've taken include Java 1 and 2, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Database Design and Implementation. This past spring semester (Spring 2022), I took an Operating Systems and Networks class (which used C++) and an Introduction to Artifical Intelligence class.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenging, innovative, and exciting projects that will make a difference in the world.
